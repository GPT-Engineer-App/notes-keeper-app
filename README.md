# notes-keeper-app

I have an API at https://api.zerosheets.com/v1/7ox which returns a list of notes like for example: 

[
  {
    "_lineNumber": 2,
    "name": "note",
    "content": "adas dsadsa ldjsal jsajdlkasd"
  },
  {
    "_lineNumber": 3,
    "name": "sdadsa",
    "content": "sadkjsadj djsalkdjsalk asdjlaskdj "
  }
]


All crud actions are allowed. Could you please implement an app like gogle keep for this api?
